              The event kicked off with an energetic march, featuring
              participants carrying banners and placards displaying messages
              advocating for legal rights and justice. Held on 09.11.2023 in
              commemoration of National Legal Service Day, the rally had the
              theme, “Access to Justice is a right to all – Know your right.” It
              commenced at 10:30 AM from Thiruporur bus terminus, with
              approximately 50 students from all sections of the 3rd and
              2nd-year batches. The Para-legal Volunteers of the Legal Aid
              Clinic of VMLS organized the rally under the guidance of its
              faculty coordinator, Dr. Krishna Kishore.
