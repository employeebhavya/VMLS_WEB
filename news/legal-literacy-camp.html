              In commemoration of Constitutional Day, VMLS Global Tamil Law
              Center (GTLC) organized a legal literacy camp, aligning with the
              vision of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to transform political democracy into
              social democracy. This report outlines the event’s objectives,
              activities, and the impact on the Irular Tribes community.

              The primary objective of the camp was to empower the Irular Tribes
              community through education, focusing on the importance of
              education, creating awareness about the POCSO Act, and
              enlightening them about the detrimental effects of early child
              marriage.

            <h3>Event Details:</h3>
            <p>
              On November 18th, the “Global Tamil Law Center” orchestrated a
              legal literacy camp for the Irular Tribes, addressing crucial
              issues such as the significance of education, the fundamentals of
              the POCSO Act, and the perils of early child marriage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h3>Activities and Impact:</h3>
            <p>
              Vinayaka Mission’s Law School students played a pivotal role in
              educating the Irular community. They conducted informative
              sessions on the importance of education, the key provisions of the
              POCSO Act, and the negative consequences associated with early
              child marriage. Utilizing innovative gameplay methods, the
              students effectively engaged both children and parents. The
              success of the event was palpable in the positive response from
              the community, reflected in the smiles on the faces of the
              children and their parents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of the event was made possible through the dedicated
              efforts of our faculty coordinator, Dr. Fowmina, whose
              instrumental role significantly contributed to the event’s
              success. Special thanks were extended to Mr. Saravanan Ravi for
              his unwavering support and active presence throughout the camp.
              The constant support, guidance, and motivation from our Dean, Dr.
              Ananth Padmanaban, were invaluable.

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
              Vinayaka Mission’s Law School, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s words,
              “Be the change you want to see in the world,” has taken a
              significant step towards initiating positive change. The legal
              literacy camp not only educated the Irular community but also
              embodied the institution’s commitment to building a society
              founded on principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
