              Corporate and Financial Laws and LL.M. in Commercial Dispute
              Resolution. These programs are designed to equip students with
              in-depth legal expertise and practical skills essential for

              Hon’ble Chief Justice (Retd.) S. Vaidyanathan of the Meghalaya
              High Court delivered the keynote address, emphasizing the
              advantages of pursuing a specialized LL.M. program. Dr. Ananth

              opportunities in public policy and technology law. Dr. Padmanabhan
              stated "In today’s dynamic legal landscape, a specialized LL.M. is
              not just an academic pursuit but a strategic advantage, equipping
              lawyers to tackle emerging complexities with precision."
