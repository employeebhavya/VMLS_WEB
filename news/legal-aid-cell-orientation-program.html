              The primary objective of the camp was to empower the Irular Tribes
              community through education, focusing on the importance of
              education, creating awareness about the POCSO Act, and
              enlightening them about the detrimental effects of early child

            <h3>Event Overview:</h3>
            <p>
              The orientation program focused on the role of law students in
              providing free legal aid to society. It provided an opportunity
              for students to gain valuable insights and knowledge about their
              potential contributions in this important area. The program
              witnessed an exceptional level of enthusiasm and active engagement
              from our law students, demonstrating their eagerness to learn and
              make a positive impact. The program truly emphasized the crucial
              role that law students can play in promoting free legal aid. The
              event served as a platform to raise awareness about the
              significance of offering legal assistance to marginalized
              individuals and communities who often lack access to legal
              resources. It encouraged students to harness their legal knowledge
              and skills to contribute positively to society by providing pro
              bono services and supporting those in need.
            </p>
            <p>
              We extend our deepest appreciation to Mr. V. Sundharesan, our
              esteemed guest speaker, for gracing the event with his presence
              and sharing valuable insights. His contributions left a lasting
              impact on the participants, inspiring them to become proactive
              agents of change in society through their legal skills and
              knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              We extend a special note of gratitude to Dean Dr. Ananth
              Padmanaban for his unwavering support throughout the planning and
              execution of the orientation program. His guidance, encouragement,
              and visionary leadership played a pivotal role in making this
              event a resounding success.
