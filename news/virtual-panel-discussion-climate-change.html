            <p>
              The Research Committee of Vinayaka Mission’s Law School (VMLS)
              organized a virtual panel discussion on recent landmark judgments
              by the Supreme Court of India and the European Court of Human
              Rights (ECHR). The discussion focused on two significant cases:
              M.K. Ranjitsinh v. Union of India (The Great Indian Bustard case)
              and Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v. Switzerland
              (KlimaSeniorinnen). These judgments hold immense importance in the
              legal landscape of climate change.

            <h3>Overview of the Judgments</h3>

            <h4>
              M.K. Ranjitsinh v. Union of India (The Great Indian Bustard case):
            </h4>
            <p>
              This case addressed the critical issue of protecting the
              endangered Great Indian Bustard. The Supreme Court of India
              delivered a judgment that emphasized the need for immediate and
              stringent measures to conserve this species and its habitat. Key
              points discussed included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The legal obligations of the Indian government under national
                and international law to protect endangered species.
              </li>
              <li>
                The role of environmental impact assessments in preventing
                habitat destruction.
              </li>
              <li>
                The broader implications of the judgment for wildlife
                conservation in India.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
              Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v. Switzerland
              (KlimaSeniorinnen):
            </h4>
            <p>
              The ECHR’s judgment in this case underscored the responsibility of
              governments to address climate change and its impacts on
              vulnerable populations. The discussion highlighted:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The court’s recognition of the direct impact of climate change
                on human rights, particularly the rights of elderly women.
              </li>
              <li>
                The significance of this ruling in holding governments
                accountable for their climate policies.
              </li>
              <li>
                The potential influence of this judgment on future climate
                litigation in Europe and globally.
