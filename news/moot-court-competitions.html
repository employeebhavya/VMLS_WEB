            <h3>Event Planning and Registration:</h3>
            <p>
              In line with the academic calendar development, the MCC allocated
              two days for the Internal Moot competition. Prior to releasing the
              moot proposition, orientation sessions were conducted for
              students, organized class-wise during dedicated MCC hours. The
              proposition was officially released on May 6th, and interested
              students were requested to register by May 9th. A total of 8 teams
              participated in the event.

            <h3>Competition Rounds:</h3>
            <p>
              The event spanned two full days, commencing on May 25th, 2023. The
              initial day comprised knockout rounds, including preliminary
              rounds for both prosecution and defense. Each team had the
              opportunity to present arguments from both sides, resulting in two
              knockout rounds. Faculty members were appointed as judges for the
              knockout rounds and semifinals

            <h3>Semi-Finals and Finals:</h3>
            <p>
              The top four teams with the highest scores advanced to the
              semi-finals. The results of the semi-finals were announced on the
              same day. The finalists were selected through a knock-out process.
              Two experienced advocates, Mrithun (Practicing Advocate) and Manav
              (In-house Counsel), were invited to judge the final round. After
              the completion of all rounds, the judges provided feedback to the
              participants and addressed the student audience, emphasizing the
              significance of mooting in a law student’s career and
              participation in national moot court competitions.
