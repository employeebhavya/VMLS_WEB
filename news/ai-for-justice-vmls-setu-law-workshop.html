            <p>
              The Centre for Justice through Technology (CJT) at VMLS, in
              collaboration with Setu.Law, successfully conducted an interactive
              workshop titled "Crafting Impact through AI at the Grassroots
              Level: Legal, Tech, and Policy." Ms. Avanti Durani Mittal, CEO of
              Setu Law provided valuable insights to the VMLS students on how
              artificial intelligence can be leveraged to address legal and
              policy challenges faced by underprivileged communities.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Engaging Interactive Exercises: Students actively participated
                in problem-solving activities that demonstrated how AI-driven
                solutions could be integrated into legal frameworks to enhance
                access to justice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expert Insights: The workshop featured a keynote address by
                Avanti Durani Mittal, CEO of Setu.Law, who shared valuable
                insights on the intersection of AI, law, and social impact.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborative Project Development: As an institutional partner
                with VMLS under a Letter of Engagement, Setu.Law will work with
                CJT and the Legal Aid Cell on consultative projects aimed at
                developing AI-assisted legal solutions for marginalized groups.
              </li>
              <li>
                Practical Learning for Students: The event provided an excellent
                opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience in
                leveraging AI for legal research, policy analysis, and
                grassroots-level impact initiatives.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Future Prospects:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The partnership between CJT, VMLS, and Setu.Law will continue to
                evolve through dedicated projects that integrate AI and legal
                aid efforts. These initiatives will focus on developing scalable
                solutions to tackle legal challenges faced by underserved
                communities, ensuring that technology plays a transformative
                role in promoting justice and equity.
              </li>
              <li>
                The success of this workshop marks a significant step in
                advancing the mission of the CJT at VMLS to bridge the gap
                between law, technology, and social justice.
