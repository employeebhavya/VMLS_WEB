          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The NSS (National Service Scheme) wing of Vinayaka Missions Law
              School, in association with the Tamil Nadu State Wetland Authority
              and Ooruni Foundation, organized a lake cleaning drive on
              4-06-2023 and 5-06-2023. The event was conducted to commemorate
              World Environment Day and raise awareness about environmental
              conservation and waste management under the theme “Waste to
              Wealth.” The enthusiastic participation of the students made the
              event a resounding success.

              A speech competition on the topic “Waste to Wealth” was the
              highlight of the event. Students took turns delivering insightful
              speeches, highlighting innovative approaches to waste management
              and the potential economic benefits associated with recycling and
              upcycling. Their passion and knowledge resonated with the
              audience, inspiring everyone to take action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, students also showcased various artworks that were
              created from wastage, highlighting the potential of turning waste
              materials into useful products. After the speeches and art
              exhibition, it was time for the students to put their words into
              action. Equipped with gloves, bags, and a strong determination,
              they embarked on a mission to clean the lake and its surroundings.
              Working in teams, they scoured every nook and cranny, collecting
              litter and debris that had accumulated over time. Laughter and
              camaraderie filled the air as the students embraced the spirit of
              teamwork and shared purpose. Their collective efforts transformed
              the lake’s appearance, restoring its natural beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Students Ms. Gowri and Mr. Rishi Kesavan were presented with
              the best speakers award for their informative and eloquent speech.
              Our joint efforts and shared vision created a conducive
              environment for raising awareness about environmental
              conservation. The lake cleaning drive highlighted the importance
              of partnerships in addressing environmental challenges and
              fostering sustainable practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the day drew to a close, the impact of the event was palpable.
              The students had not only cleaned the lake but had also left a
              lasting impression on the minds of all who witnessed their
              dedication. The event served as a reminder of our responsibility
              to protect the environment and utilize waste as a valuable
              resource. The lake cleaning drive organized by the NSS wing of
              Vinayaka Missions Law School was a testament to the students’
              commitment to environmental conservation and their ability to
              effect positive change.
