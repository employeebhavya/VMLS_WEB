              Advocate Uma Maheswari began by introducing the participants to
              the concept of e-filing, explaining its importance in the modern

              The resource person provided a comprehensive, step-by-step
              demonstration on how to file cases digitally. This included the
              preparation of documents, uploading them to the relevant court
              portals, and addressing common challenges faced during the
              process.
            </p>
