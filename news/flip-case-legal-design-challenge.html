            <p>
              The primary aim of the Flip Case challenge was to encourage law
              students to step outside conventional thinking and explore legal
              issues through design methodologies. The event promoted

            <p>
              Participants were tasked with transforming legal scenarios by
              employing design thinking principles. They were given complex
              cases to analyze and then asked to 'flip' the case by redesigning
              the legal process or solution to make it more accessible,
              efficient, and user-friendly.
            </p>
