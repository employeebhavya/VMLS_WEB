              We are absolutely thrilled to announce the successful conclusion
              of the highly anticipated event on the digitization of courts in
              India, organized by Center for Justice through Technology (CJT)!
              The event was held at Hotel Habilis, Guindy, to explore the
              transformative path of the E-Courts Integrated Mission Mode
              Project and the visionary strides taken by Justice S. Muralidhar
              in leveraging technology for the betterment of justice seekers.

              The event was a deep dive into the realm of digital transformation
              and its immense potential in revolutionizing the legal landscape.
              It was an electrifying atmosphere filled with insightful
              discussions, thought-provoking panel sessions, and inspiring
              keynotes.

              We thank the event coordinators Ms. Gunjan Saxena and Ms. Sinjini
              Sen for making this event a grand success. We also thank our dean
              Dr. Ananth Padmanaban and Mr. Antony. R. Julian, Convenor of CJT
              for their guidance and visionary leadership.

            <h3>The following are some of the key highlights of the event:</h3>
            <p>
              In his welcoming speech, Dr. Ananth Padmanabhan, the Dean of
              Vinayaka Mission’s Law School, emphasized the institution’s unique
              educational model. He elaborated on how their approach seamlessly
              blends a global outlook with local applicability, providing
              students with a holistic legal education that addresses both
              international standards and regional requirements. This innovative
              pedagogical method simplifies intricate legal concepts, making
              them accessible even to students who primarily think in their
              regional languages. The institution’s unwavering commitment lies
              in dismantling language and merit barriers, ensuring that students
              from diverse backgrounds enjoy equal access to legal education.
              This model epitomizes their dedication to bridging the gap between
              global relevance and local inclusivity in legal education.
            </p>
            <p>
              During his presentation, Mr. Antony R Julian, the Convenor of the
              Center for Justice through Technology (CJT), emphasized the
              pivotal role of technology in enhancing access to justice. He
              illustrated this idea with the example of the Kleros protocol
              platform, showcasing how technology is reshaping traditional legal
              processes. Mr. Julian also elaborated on CJT’s vision and mission,
              describing it as an incubator for social and economic justice. CJT
              is dedicated to harnessing technology to create a more equitable
              legal system and promote positive social and economic change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Justice Muralidhar, in his keynote speech, stressed the urgent
              need for digitization of court records and the establishment of a
              robust e-court system across the country. He noted the resistance
              to this change among lawyers and law clerks, who feared becoming
              redundant as their work shifted online. Justice Muralidhar, a
              pioneer in digitizing district courts and the High Court in
              Odisha, acknowledged a technological divide among lawyers and
              opted for a supportive approach, offering to scan and upload hard
              copies of petitions while providing training at e-seva kiosks. He
              emphasized the importance of leadership, cooperation, and long
              tenures for successful digitization initiatives and highlighted
              the need for dedicated technical support in the judiciary’s
              e-courts program.
