          <p>
            A professional law degree has become increasingly appealing to
            students since India’s liberalization in the early 90s, driven by
            the opening of domestic markets, the rise in global trade, and the
            complexities of the new economic order. This spurred demand for
            smart, articulate, and competent professionals to lead in areas like
            mergers and acquisitions, private equity, venture capital
            investments, offshore tax structures, and complex commercial
            transactions. Consequently, national law schools and five-year
            programs gained prominence as law firms and companies sought to hire
            new graduates with attractive pay packages.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, subsequent economic and socio-political changes have
            necessitated a reevaluation of legal education. The increasing
            presence of technology and automation, the need for reimagining
            dispute resolution, the expansion of a regulatory state, and the
            weakening of strict separation between disciplines require new
            models of legal education. While earlier, new graduates were hired
            for due diligence in law firms, today, AI-powered assistants handle
            such tasks. Yet, there remains a growing need for talent and
            leadership at the middle and top levels due to the increasing
            complexity of the legal and regulatory architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Litigation in courts remains a major career option, but dispute
            management through alternative dispute resolution methods like
            commercial arbitration and mediation is increasingly being sought
            after. To fully leverage this demand, legal education must
            incorporate new skills, including data literacy and a basic
            understanding of business and governance processes. The job market
            is also undergoing structural changes with the rise of the gig
            economy, offering exciting work and rewards for those who manage
            time and network effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            VMLS’ law degree is designed to meet these new challenges by molding
            young minds through a pedagogical process that considers these
            changes and equips them with new skills and professional
            capabilities. At VMLS, we value innovation in legal education,
            placing considerable emphasis on course design that addresses the
            identified skill gaps and experiential learning models that provide
            students with hands-on exposure to the professional world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our faculty comprises a mix of legal scholars and practitioners who
            excel in research and training. We envision the teacher as a
            facilitator guiding students through the learning process. Our
            well-funded teaching support unit is committed to integrating
            cutting-edge teaching methods into our daily classroom experience.
            We also aim to create tie-ups with foreign universities for exchange
            programs and joint research initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effective communication is crucial for a successful legal career.
            VMLS’ Communications and English Language Lab (CELL) provides
            foundational communication skills, including grammar, reading,
            writing, and public speaking. We offer a unique curriculum and
            teaching methods to support learners who may have limited exposure
            to English as a working language.
          </p>
          <h3>Central Themes Shaping Legal Education at VMLS</h3>

          <h3>Technology Integration</h3>
          <p>
            The dominant presence of technology and its impact on legal systems
            and frameworks necessitate a focus on technology and technology
            policy as part of the legal curriculum. From basics to advanced
            concepts, students gain a comprehensive understanding of the legal
            and regulatory frameworks governing technology. Courses integrate
            technology into core subjects like constitutional law, criminal law,
            and contracts, with electives covering areas like data protection
            and regulation of the digital economy. Our clinical courses equip
            students with technology licensing skills and an understanding of
            policy-making.
          </p>
          <h3>Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)</h3>
          <p>
            ADR methods are increasingly central to dispute resolution
            strategies. The growth of institutions conducting professional ADR
            has made these methods primary in commercial settings. Courts have
            also adopted innovative ADR strategies, such as commercial courts
            deploying informal strategies before trial. Our curriculum captures
            these skills, preparing students for diverse settings, from labor
            mediation to international commercial arbitration. The Global Tamil
            Law Centre (GTLC) also supports this vision by addressing challenges
            pertaining to access to justice within the State of Tamil Nadu.

          <h3>Regulatory State</h3>
          <p>
            The rise of the regulatory state impacts the role of lawyers,
            requiring a reevaluation of core courses like constitutional and
            administrative law. Lawyers now engage extensively with regulatory
            bodies, guiding regulated entities on the applicable laws and
            regulations. A sound understanding of jurisprudence, economic and
            political thought, and behavioral aspects of governance is essential
            to perform this role. VMLS’ curriculum is structured to meet these
            demands.

          <h3>Internationalization and Comparative Law</h3>
          <p>
            Internationalization and comparative law have become integral to
            legal education. Policies are shaped by international pressures, and
            legal principles from across the globe inform domestic law. Our
            curriculum exposes students to fundamental themes and global
            debates, preparing them to navigate both Indian and international
            legal landscapes. The Centre for the Promotion of International Law
            exemplifies our commitment, with initiatives like an e-journal
            focusing on present-day international conflict and guest lectures on
            sustainable growth standing out in this regard.
          </p>

          <p>

            pioneering model in Indian legal education. Our faculty and support
