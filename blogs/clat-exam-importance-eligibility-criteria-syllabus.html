            <h2>What is the CLAT Exam?</h2>
            <p>
              CLAT is a national-level entrance exam, and it stands for Common
              Law Entrance Test. Many top law universities in India consider the
              CLAT exam scores for admission in their undergraduate and graduate
              programs. Twenty-four National Law Universities (NLUs) consider
              the CLAT score for law students. Along with these twenty-four
              NLUs, the CLAT score is also considered by the other top sixty
              colleges in India. The test is mainly conducted for admission in
              the five-year undergraduate
              <a href="https://vmls.edu.in/"> LLB</a> and one-year postgraduate
              LLM programmes.
            </p>

              Every law aspirant dreams of studying in a top law college. So,
              taking the CLAT exam opens this opportunity for law students. This
              exam is important as it not only allows students to be eligible
              for admission to top NLUs but also many Public Sector Undertakings
              (PSUs) consider the CLAT LLM score for recruiting candidates.
              Also, the private colleges considering CLAT scores for admission
              offer various scholarships to rank holders. All these benefits
              signify the importance of this exam very well. However, the exam
              is highly competitive, and students must score good marks and a
              higher rank to get admitted to the most notable law schools in
              India.
