              What is the Difference Between 5-Year and 3-Year Degree Courses?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Before choosing the right course for your education, it’s
              necessary to consider the law course duration. So, in India, you
              can complete your LLB in either 5 years or 3 years. The 5-year
              course is a pretty popular choice for students as it combines law
              studies with a specific discipline. It can include combining law
              with subjects like arts, business, science, commerce, or
              technology. The 5-year degree can be opted for right after
              completing your 12th-grade studies. On the other hand, a 3-year
              degree is chosen after completing a bachelor's degree. It offers
              exposure to various law subjects like constitutional law, criminal
              law, and many more. It helps students to seek opportunities across
              diverse fields.
