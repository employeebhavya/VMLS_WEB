              If you are willing to work in a legal advisory firm, judiciary, or
              as a lawyer, then pursuing a law degree plays an important role in
              your career. However, there are several subjects law students are
              supposed to study. It may include constitutional law, taxation
              law, family law, and so on. Also, most of these subjects are
              common in a three-year and five-year
              <a href="https://www.vmls.edu.in/"> law degree.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The only difference is that a five-year law degree allows you to
              study other disciplines like business, arts, commerce, science and
              technology. The five-year degree has courses namely the BA LLB,
              B.Com LLB, B.Tech LLB, B.Sc LLB, and BBA LLB. And, the three-year
              degree course i.e. LLB can be completed after your graduation

              subjects is essential. There are several law subjects, but major
              subjects include constitutional law, property law, etc. While

                <h3>Constitutional Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  As the name suggests, constitutional law includes the study of
                  different principles and procedures involved in government
                  activities. It includes knowing about the rules and
                  regulations that need to be followed while running a nation.
                  It is the best subject for law students interested in
                  legislative, executive, and judiciary practices. This subject
                  not only helps students know about the workings of government
                  bodies, their relationship with the country's people, and
                  other government bodies for easy functioning.

                <h3>Criminal Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  Lawyers practising criminal law are involved in resolving
                  criminal offence occurrences, trial processes, fixing offence
                  charges, and various related procedures. They are generally
                  aligned towards protecting society and maintaining peace in
                  daily life. Criminal laws differ in different countries and
                  must be studied according to the nation’s policies. In India,
                  any college’s law course details can provide necessary details
                  regarding the topics included while studying criminal law and
                  other related subjects.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Civil Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  Civil law involves regulating the obligations and rights of
                  individuals, along with the legal relations between them. It
                  is associated with non-criminal matters like property,
                  divorce, money, contracts, etc. Law colleges in India focusing
                  on this subject may involve various topics like contract law,
                  family law, and torts law for a better understanding. One must
                  understand that civil law is different from criminal law and
                  common law. Hence, it is essential to study this subject while
                  pursuing your LLB degree.

              <li>
                <h3>Property Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  The study of property law allows you to know the rules and
                  regulations related to resources like land or personal
                  property. These rules are different as per the different types
                  of property, and many law colleges in India teach this subject
                  due to its greater importance. It involves regulating the
                  transfer of property either movable or immovable from one
                  individual to another. While pursuing an LLB, property law is
                  taught as a major subject, and law students get to know
                  various laws and rules associated with it.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h3>Environmental Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  The rise in global environmental conditions resulted in the
                  establishment of strict laws for environment conservation in
                  each country. As a result environmental law plays a major
                  role, and it stresses the importance of climate change,
                  disposal laws, effluent disposal, environmental protection,
                  harmful waste management, etc. Law students with a master’s
                  degree in environmental law can build a strong career in this
                  field. They can work as environmentalists, lawyers,
                  socialists, and in several professions.

              <li>
                <h3>Corporate Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  It is essential to maintain governance while managing
                  businesses, so, corporate law plays a major role in this
                  regard. It includes the corporate jurisdictions, management,
                  and other topics related to companies and their working. Some
                  common cases under corporate laws include share issues and
                  frauds, management issues, investor issues, and many more. An
                  LLB degree with a specialization in corporate law can land you
                  a great job in companies as a corporate lawyer or consultant
                  with a great salary.

                <h3>Human Rights Law:</h3>
                <p>
                  Human Rights laws are important in today’s world, and lawyers
                  practising them ensure the right to livelihood, political
                  rights, social rights, and several rights on the grounds of
                  humanity. It is usually offered as an elective subject along
                  with the other compulsory BA LLB subjects. However, majoring
                  in this subject can allow you to work with great organizations
                  like the United Nations. Several top law colleges in India
                  provide various specialization courses and degrees focusing on

                <p>
                  The intellectual property law ensures the protection of
                  inventions and discoveries by a person or company from unfair
                  practices. It allows you to study the intricacies of
